# SearchbookApp
An android app used to search for any book (either by Author, ISBN, Book Title etc.) online using the [OpenLibrary API] (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) with links to Goodreads, Library of Congress etc. 

Below are the screen shots of the app. 

### More Improvements still being made:

1.  Peview much more details of any book-publication date, number of pages, Good reads URL, Library of Congress URL(where necessary).
2.  UI drawer which enables users to search by ISBN, Author, Title
3.  Animations added while previewing each book
4.  ~~Share book found with friends on Social media platforms.~~ **Done**
5.  ~~Pull down/ Swipe to Refresh new books~~ **Done**

And much more.
